  I am a sociologist and demographer at the Research Data Centre of the Institute for Employment Research ([FDZ-IAB](https://fdz.iab.de/en.aspx) ) in Nuremberg (Germany). 
  
  My research focuses upon how couples navigate the labour market when transitioning into parenthood. Currently, I am part of an international project where we analyse the employment trajectories of mothers in France and Germany. Another current project explores the determinants and consequences of father's parental leave.
  
  I enjoy the linkage, procurement, and analysis of data using R and Stata. In a recent [paper](/publication/2022_update_identifying_mothers/), we updated the identification process of mothers in the labour market data at the IAB. Another [paper]() provides smartphone-based mobility indicators for PASS participations. Currently, I am developing an [R-shiny](shiny.rstudio.com/) dashboard to streamline data applications at the FDZ-IAB.
  
  Moreover, I am interested in consequences of imbalanced numbers of women and men in groups or regions, i.e. imbalanced sex ratios. In my dissertation project, I analysed how skewed sex ratios are associated with the formation of relationships, risk-taking, and violence.
  
  Beyond research, I enjoy teaching applied statistics and programming using R and Stata. Find a collection of course materials [here](/courses).
